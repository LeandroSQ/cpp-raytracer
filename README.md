## Project
This is a simple implementation of a ray tracing engine in C++. This project is still a work in progress, expect bugs.

My intention is to register my learnings throughout this project in this repository.

## Dev log
### Day 0
I had my experiments with Ray tracing before but never really got serious. I was able to achieve something similar with AssemblyScript compiling to WASM, but the performance wasn't really what I was expecting, which led me to try with native C++ and SDL.

I started learning the basics of SDL, it has been a while since my last SDL project.

### Day 1
After a few side projects in SDL, it's time to start ray tracing!

This was basically the first day. Where I got some basic ray casting working.

It seems that doing the operations in the back buffer penalizes performance when setting pixels manually, maybe having a surface and manipulating it manually would provide a better performance, since now the actual ray tracing takes 6ms tops and the back buffer manipulation takes 40ms ðŸ˜•.
